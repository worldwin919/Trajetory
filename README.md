ðŸŒŒ Celestial Trajectory Prediction Using Deep Learning & AI
Using deep learning and machine learning with physics based models to predict trajectory of celestial bodies like asteroids , planets, moons

This project aims to predict the future trajectories of celestial bodies (e.g., asteroids, planets, satellites) using deep learning techniques, specifically Transformer-based and LSTM-based architectures. It leverages time-series data and AI to model and forecast motion in dynamic space environments with high accuracy.

ðŸ”­ Features
ðŸš€ Predicts orbital paths based on historical spatial data

ðŸ§  Uses Transformer and LSTM models for temporal sequence prediction

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizes predicted vs. actual trajectories for evaluation

ðŸŽ¯ Focused on scientific accuracy and real-world relevance

ðŸ’¡ Designed for integration with larger simulation or satellite tracking systems
